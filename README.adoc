The Gravity Database
====================

Just as gravity connects the universe it now connects data behind the
scenes, too.

Gravity is a graph database trying to make the traversal as easy as
possible for complex data. There are several goals it tries to archive:

* provide an elegant way to traverse
* be scalable (not just in scaling up, but also in scaling down to the
  footprint of mobile phones)
* can be easily split, distributed, shared and merged

Getting started
---------------
There are different ways of using gravitydb in your appliction

* standalone
* as a library which can be embedded

Using it as a library is the main use case. It is highly customizable.

The program is written in literate programming style, so you can find
all the documentation in the `docs` folder.
